The-kth-factor-of-n

Intuition ðŸ‘ˆ
The question is very simple. It is given nnn and kkk, where we have to find the factors of the number n and we have to return the kth factor of n. 
For example, n=12 and k=3,the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The 3rd factor is 3, so we will return 3.

Approach:
We will simply iterate from 1 to n and maintain a count.
The count will tally the number of factors. 
As soon as the count matches k, we will return i.
If there is no match or there are no factors, we will return -1.

code only function:

class Solution(object):
    def kthFactor(self, n, k):
        """
        :type n: int
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        count=0
        for i in range (1,n+1):
            if n % i==0:
                count=count+1
                if count==k:
                    return i
        return -1
